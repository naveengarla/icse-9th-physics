# Glossary - Pressure in Fluids

## A

**Absolute Pressure**: The total pressure measured from absolute zero (complete vacuum). It equals atmospheric pressure plus gauge pressure.

**Atmospheric Pressure**: The pressure exerted by the weight of the atmosphere. Standard atmospheric pressure at sea level is 101,325 Pa or 1 atm.

## B

**Barometer**: An instrument used to measure atmospheric pressure, commonly using mercury or aneroid mechanisms.

**Buoyancy**: The upward force exerted by a fluid on an object immersed in it, equal to the weight of fluid displaced (Archimedes' principle).

## C

**Communicating Vessels**: Connected containers that allow fluid to flow between them, resulting in equal liquid levels in all vessels.

**Compressibility**: The property of a substance to decrease in volume when pressure is applied. Liquids are nearly incompressible, gases are highly compressible.

## D

**Density (ρ)**: Mass per unit volume of a substance, measured in kg/m³. It determines how much pressure a fluid column will create.

**Depth**: The vertical distance below the surface of a fluid. Pressure increases linearly with depth in a fluid.

## F

**Fluid**: A substance that can flow and take the shape of its container. Includes both liquids and gases.

**Force Multiplication**: The increase in output force achieved through hydraulic systems using Pascal's law and different piston areas.

## G

**Gauge Pressure**: Pressure measured relative to atmospheric pressure. It's the difference between absolute pressure and atmospheric pressure.

## H

**Hydraulic Press**: A machine that uses Pascal's law to multiply force by applying pressure to a confined fluid in cylinders of different areas.

**Hydraulic System**: A technology that uses pressurized fluid to generate, control, and transmit force and motion.

**Hydrostatic Pressure**: The pressure exerted by a fluid at rest due to the force of gravity acting on the fluid column above.

## I

**Incompressible**: A property of liquids where volume changes negligibly under normal pressure changes, making them suitable for hydraulic systems.

## L

**Liquid Column**: A vertical section of liquid used to calculate pressure. The height of this column determines the hydrostatic pressure.

## M

**Manometer**: An instrument used to measure the pressure of gases or liquids, often using U-shaped tubes with mercury or water.

**Mechanical Advantage**: The ratio of output force to input force in a machine. In hydraulic systems, it equals the ratio of piston areas.

## P

**Pascal (Pa)**: The SI unit of pressure, equal to one Newton per square meter (N/m²).

**Pascal's Law**: States that pressure applied to a confined liquid is transmitted undiminished in all directions throughout the liquid.

**Pressure**: Force per unit area, measured in Pascals. In fluids, it acts perpendicular to surfaces and equally in all directions at a point.

**Piston**: A moving component in a cylinder that creates or responds to pressure changes in hydraulic systems.

## S

**Specific Gravity**: The ratio of the density of a substance to the density of water. Also called relative density.

**Static Fluid**: A fluid at rest, not flowing. Static fluid pressure follows specific laws and depends only on depth and fluid properties.

## T

**Thrust**: The total perpendicular force acting on a surface. Pressure is thrust divided by the area of the surface.

**Torr**: A unit of pressure equal to 1/760 of standard atmospheric pressure, approximately equal to 1 mmHg.

## U

**Upthrust**: The upward buoyant force exerted by a fluid on an immersed object, opposing the object's weight.
