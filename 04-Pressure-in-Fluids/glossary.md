# Glossary - Pressure in Fluids

## A

**Absolute Pressure**: The total pressure at a point, including atmospheric pressure. Equal to gauge pressure plus atmospheric pressure.

**Atmospheric Pressure**: The pressure exerted by the atmosphere at any point due to the weight of air column above it. Standard value: 101,325 Pa.

**Archimedes' Principle**: A body immersed in a fluid experiences an upward buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced.

## B

**Barometer**: An instrument used to measure atmospheric pressure. Mercury barometer uses height of mercury column.

**Buoyancy**: The upward force exerted by a fluid on an immersed object, caused by pressure difference between top and bottom of the object.

## C

**Communicating Vessels**: Containers connected at the bottom where liquid rises to the same level in all containers regardless of their shapes.

**Confined Fluid**: A fluid enclosed in a container with no escape route, essential for Pascal's law applications.

## D

**Density (ρ)**: Mass per unit volume of a substance. Unit: kg/m³. Critical factor in determining fluid pressure.

## F

**Fluid**: Any substance that can flow and take the shape of its container. Includes both liquids and gases.

**Force Multiplication**: The ability of hydraulic systems to produce large output force from small input force using Pascal's law.

## G

**Gauge Pressure**: Pressure measured relative to atmospheric pressure. Does not include atmospheric pressure component.

**Gravity (g)**: Acceleration due to gravity, standard value 9.8 m/s² or 9.81 m/s². Essential in hydrostatic pressure calculations.

## H

**Hydraulic Press**: A machine that uses Pascal's law to amplify force through the use of incompressible fluid in cylinders of different areas.

**Hydraulic System**: Any system that uses pressurized fluid to transmit power or create mechanical advantage.

**Hydrostatic Pressure**: Pressure in a fluid at rest due to gravitational force. Calculated using P = ρgh.

## I

**Incompressible Fluid**: A fluid whose density remains essentially constant under pressure. Liquids are generally considered incompressible.

## M

**Manometer**: An instrument used to measure pressure differences using liquid columns, typically in a U-shaped tube.

**Mechanical Advantage**: The ratio of output force to input force in a machine. In hydraulics, equals the ratio of piston areas.

## O

**Omnidirectional**: Property of fluid pressure acting equally in all directions at any given point.

## P

**Pascal (Pa)**: SI unit of pressure. 1 Pascal = 1 Newton per square meter (N/m²).

**Pascal's Law**: Pressure applied to any part of a confined fluid is transmitted equally and undiminished in all directions throughout the fluid.

**Pressure**: Force per unit area acting normally on a surface. P = F/A. Scalar quantity measured in Pascals.

**Piston**: A movable component in hydraulic systems that transmits force through pressurized fluid.

## S

**Static Fluid**: A fluid at rest or moving so slowly that acceleration effects are negligible.

**Surface Pressure**: Pressure at the free surface of a liquid, usually atmospheric pressure for open containers.

## T

**Thrust**: Total force acting normally (perpendicularly) on a surface. Vector quantity measured in Newtons.

**Torr**: Unit of pressure equal to 1/760 of standard atmospheric pressure. 1 Torr = 133.3 Pa.

## U

**U-tube**: A glass tube bent into U-shape, commonly used in manometers and demonstrations of pressure principles.

## W

**Weight Density**: Weight per unit volume of a substance. Related to density by: Weight density = ρg.

## Common Conversion Factors

- **1 atmosphere (atm)** = 101,325 Pa = 760 mmHg = 760 Torr
- **1 bar** = 100,000 Pa = 10⁵ Pa
- **1 mmHg** = 133.3 Pa
- **1 kPa** = 1,000 Pa
- **1 MPa** = 1,000,000 Pa

## Important Constants

- **Standard atmospheric pressure**: 101,325 Pa
- **Acceleration due to gravity**: 9.8 m/s² (or 9.81 m/s²)
- **Density of water**: 1,000 kg/m³
- **Density of mercury**: 13,600 kg/m³

## Key Relationships

- **Pressure formula**: P = F/A
- **Hydrostatic pressure**: P = ρgh
- **Pascal's law**: P₁ = P₂, therefore F₁/A₁ = F₂/A₂
- **Total pressure**: P_total = P_atmospheric + P_gauge
- **Mechanical advantage**: MA = A₂/A₁ = F₂/F₁
