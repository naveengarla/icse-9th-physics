# 4.0 Introduction to Pressure in Fluids

## Overview

Pressure in fluids is a fundamental concept in physics that explains many phenomena we observe in daily life. From the working of hydraulic machines to the behavior of liquids in containers, understanding pressure helps us comprehend the world around us.

## What are Fluids?

Fluids are substances that can flow and take the shape of their container. They include:
- **Liquids**: Water, oil, mercury, etc.
- **Gases**: Air, oxygen, carbon dioxide, etc.

## Key Characteristics of Fluids

1. **Fluidity**: Ability to flow
2. **No fixed shape**: Takes the shape of the container
3. **Compressibility**: Gases are highly compressible, liquids are nearly incompressible
4. **Pressure transmission**: Can transmit pressure in all directions

## Why Study Pressure in Fluids?

Understanding pressure in fluids helps us:
- Explain natural phenomena like atmospheric pressure
- Design hydraulic systems
- Understand how submarines work
- Explain why dams are thicker at the bottom
- Understand blood pressure in our bodies

## What You Will Learn

In this chapter, you will explore:
- The concept of thrust and pressure
- How pressure varies in fluids
- Laws governing liquid pressure
- Pascal's law and its applications
- Practical examples and numerical problems
