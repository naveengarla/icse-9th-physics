# 4.6 Pascal's Law

## Statement of Pascal's Law

**"Pressure applied to a confined liquid is transmitted undiminished in all directions throughout the liquid."**

*Named after French mathematician and physicist Blaise Pascal (1623-1662)*

## Understanding Pascal's Law

### Key Concepts:
1. **Confined Liquid**: The liquid must be enclosed in a container
2. **Undiminished**: The applied pressure is not reduced
3. **All Directions**: Pressure transmits equally in every direction
4. **Throughout**: The entire volume of liquid experiences the pressure

### Mathematical Expression:
```
P₁ = P₂ = P₃ = ... = Pₙ
```
Where pressure is the same at all points in the connected system.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Why Does Pascal's Law Work?

1. **Liquids are Nearly Incompressible**
   - Cannot reduce volume significantly under pressure
   - Must transmit force through molecular interactions

2. **Molecular Structure**
   - Liquid molecules are closely packed
   - Pressure on some molecules transfers to neighboring molecules
   - Creates chain reaction throughout the liquid

3. **Equilibrium Condition**
   - If pressure were not equal everywhere, liquid would flow
   - Static equilibrium requires equal pressure

## Mathematical Analysis

### For Connected Cylinders with Different Areas:

Consider two cylinders connected by a tube:
- Cylinder 1: Area A₁, Applied Force F₁
- Cylinder 2: Area A₂, Resulting Force F₂

**From Pascal's Law**:
```
P₁ = P₂
F₁/A₁ = F₂/A₂
```

**Therefore**:
```
F₂ = F₁ × (A₂/A₁)
```

### Force Multiplication:
- If A₂ > A₁, then F₂ > F₁ (Force is amplified)
- If A₂ < A₁, then F₂ < F₁ (Force is reduced)

### Mechanical Advantage:
```
Mechanical Advantage = F₂/F₁ = A₂/A₁
```

## Experimental Demonstration

### Pascal's Vases Experiment:
1. **Setup**: Various shaped containers connected at bottom
2. **Observation**: Water level equalizes in all containers
3. **Applied Pressure**: Press one piston - all others move
4. **Conclusion**: Pressure transmits equally throughout

### Hydraulic Press Demonstration:
1. **Small Piston**: Apply 10 N force on 1 cm² area
2. **Large Piston**: 100 cm² area experiences 1000 N force
3. **Pressure**: Same in both cylinders (10 N/cm²)
4. **Force Multiplication**: 100 times amplification
