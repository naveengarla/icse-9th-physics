# 4.3 Pressure Due to Liquid Column

## Introduction

When a liquid is at rest in a container, it exerts pressure on the bottom and sides due to its weight. This pressure is called **hydrostatic pressure**.

## Derivation of Pressure Formula

Consider a liquid column of:
- **Height**: h
- **Cross-sectional area**: A
- **Density**: ρ (rho)

### Step-by-step derivation:

1. **Volume of liquid column**: V = A × h

2. **Mass of liquid column**: m = ρ × V = ρ × A × h

3. **Weight of liquid column**: W = m × g = ρ × A × h × g

4. **Pressure at bottom**: P = Weight/Area = (ρ × A × h × g)/A

### Final Formula:
```
P = ρgh
```

Where:
- P = Pressure (Pa)
- ρ = Density of liquid (kg/m³)
- g = Acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s²)
- h = Height of liquid column (m)

## Key Observations

### 1. **Pressure depends on depth only**
- Pressure is same at all points at the same depth
- Independent of container shape or size
- Only vertical depth matters

### 2. **Pressure increases linearly with depth**
- Direct proportional relationship: P ∝ h
- Deeper points have higher pressure
- Pressure difference = ρg(h₂ - h₁)

### 3. **Pressure depends on liquid density**
- Denser liquids create more pressure
- Mercury (ρ = 13,600 kg/m³) vs Water (ρ = 1000 kg/m³)
- Same height: Mercury creates 13.6 times more pressure

## Total Pressure in a Liquid

When a liquid is open to atmosphere:
```
Total Pressure = Atmospheric Pressure + Liquid Pressure
P_total = P_atm + ρgh
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Water Tank
A water tank has water up to 2m height.
- Pressure at bottom = ρgh = 1000 × 9.8 × 2 = 19,600 Pa
- This is additional to atmospheric pressure

### Example 2: Swimming Pool
Pressure at 3m depth in a swimming pool:
- P = ρgh = 1000 × 9.8 × 3 = 29,400 Pa
- Total pressure = 101,325 + 29,400 = 130,725 Pa

### Example 3: Mercury Barometer
Mercury column of 760 mm height:
- P = ρgh = 13,600 × 9.8 × 0.76 = 101,325 Pa ≈ 1 atm

## Applications and Consequences

### 1. **Water Supply Systems**
- Water towers are built at heights
- Height provides pressure for distribution
- Higher towers → better water pressure

### 2. **Dam Construction**
- Dams are thicker at bottom
- Higher pressure at greater depths
- Pressure increases linearly with depth

### 3. **Submarine Design**
- Hull must withstand enormous pressure
- Pressure increases by ~1 atm per 10m depth
- At 100m depth: ~11 atm pressure

### 4. **Deep Sea Diving**
- Divers face increasing pressure with depth
- Decompression sickness risk
- Special equipment needed for deep dives

## Interesting Facts

1. **Ocean Pressure**: At Mariana Trench (~11 km deep), pressure is over 1000 times atmospheric pressure

2. **Human Body**: Can sense pressure changes as small as 1-2 mmHg

3. **Fish Adaptation**: Deep-sea fish have special adaptations to survive high pressures

4. **Pressure Cooking**: Uses increased pressure to cook food faster by raising boiling point

## Common Problems

### Type 1: Calculate pressure at given depth
**Problem**: Find pressure 5m below water surface.
**Solution**: P = ρgh = 1000 × 9.8 × 5 = 49,000 Pa

### Type 2: Find depth for given pressure
**Problem**: At what depth is pressure 2 atm in water?
**Solution**: 
- Excess pressure = 2 - 1 = 1 atm = 101,325 Pa
- h = P/(ρg) = 101,325/(1000 × 9.8) = 10.34 m

### Type 3: Compare different liquids
**Problem**: Compare pressure at 1m depth in water and mercury.
**Solution**: 
- Water: P = 1000 × 9.8 × 1 = 9,800 Pa
- Mercury: P = 13,600 × 9.8 × 1 = 133,280 Pa
- Ratio = 133,280/9,800 = 13.6

## Important Notes

1. ✅ **Pressure formula P = ρgh applies only to liquids at rest**
2. ✅ **Gauge pressure** (ρgh) vs **Absolute pressure** (P₀ + ρgh)
3. ✅ **Shape independence**: Pressure depends only on vertical height
4. ✅ **Reference level**: Always measure height from the point of interest upward
