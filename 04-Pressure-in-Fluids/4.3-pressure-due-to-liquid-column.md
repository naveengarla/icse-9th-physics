# 4.3 Pressure Due to Liquid Column

## Hydrostatic Pressure

**Hydrostatic pressure** is the pressure exerted by a fluid at rest due to the force of gravity.

## Derivation of Pressure Formula

Consider a liquid column of:
- Height: h
- Density: ρ (rho)
- Cross-sectional area: A
- Acceleration due to gravity: g

### Step-by-Step Derivation

1. **Volume of liquid column**: V = A × h

2. **Mass of liquid column**: m = ρ × V = ρ × A × h

3. **Weight of liquid column**: W = m × g = ρ × A × h × g

4. **Pressure at the base**: P = Weight/Area = (ρ × A × h × g)/A

5. **Final formula**: P = ρgh

## Formula for Liquid Column Pressure

```
P = ρgh
```

Where:
- P = Pressure at depth h
- ρ = Density of the liquid (kg/m³)
- g = Acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s²)
- h = Height/depth of liquid column (m)

## Key Points about Liquid Pressure

### 1. Depth Dependence
- Pressure increases linearly with depth
- At the surface (h = 0), pressure = 0 (gauge pressure)

### 2. Density Dependence
- Denser liquids exert more pressure at the same depth
- Mercury creates much higher pressure than water

### 3. Independence from Container Shape
- Pressure depends only on vertical height, not container shape
- Wide or narrow containers give same pressure at same depth

### 4. Atmospheric Pressure Addition
Total pressure = Atmospheric pressure + Gauge pressure
P_total = P_atm + ρgh

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Swimming Pool
For a 2m deep swimming pool:
- P = ρgh = 1000 × 9.8 × 2 = 19,600 Pa
- This is the gauge pressure at the bottom

### Example 2: Mercury Column
Mercury barometer with 760mm column:
- P = 13,600 × 9.8 × 0.76 = 101,293 Pa ≈ 1 atm

## Applications

1. **Water Tanks**: Pressure increases with height of water level
2. **Dams**: Must withstand enormous pressure at the base
3. **Submarines**: Experience crushing pressure at great depths
4. **Pressure Gauges**: Use liquid columns to measure pressure
5. **Manometers**: Measure pressure differences using liquid columns

## Factors Affecting Liquid Pressure

### Factors that DO affect pressure:
- Height/depth of liquid column
- Density of the liquid
- Acceleration due to gravity

### Factors that DON'T affect pressure:
- Shape of the container
- Total volume of liquid
- Area of the container base
