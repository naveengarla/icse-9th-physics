- Density of water (ρ) = 1000 kg/m³
- g = 9.8 m/s²

## Pressure in Different Liquids

### Example 4: Comparing Pressures
**Problem**: Compare the pressure at 1 m depth in water and mercury.

- Density of mercury (ρ₂) = 13,600 kg/m³
- g = 9.8 m/s²

**Solution**:
```
Pressure in water: P₁ = ρ₁gh = 1000 × 9.8 × 1 = 9,800 Pa
Pressure in mercury: P₂ = ρ₂gh = 13,600 × 9.8 × 1 = 133,280 Pa
Ratio: P₂/P₁ = 133,280/9,800 = 13.6

### Example 5: Equal Pressure Depth
**Problem**: At what depth in oil (density = 800 kg/m³) will the pressure be equal to the pressure at 2 m depth in water?

**Given**:
- Water depth (h₁) = 2 m
- Water density (ρ₁) = 1000 kg/m³
- Oil density (ρ₂) = 800 kg/m³

**Solution**:
```
Pressure in water: P₁ = ρ₁gh₁ = 1000 × 9.8 × 2 = 19,600 Pa
For equal pressure in oil: P₂ = P₁ = 19,600 Pa
P₂ = ρ₂gh₂
19,600 = 800 × 9.8 × h₂
h₂ = 19,600 / (800 × 9.8) = 2.5 m
```

**Answer**: 2.5 m depth in oil

## Pascal's Law Applications

### Example 6: Hydraulic Press
**Problem**: In a hydraulic press, the small piston has an area of 10 cm² and the large piston has an area of 200 cm². If a force of 100 N is applied to the small piston, find the force on the large piston.

**Given**:
- Small piston area (A₁) = 10 cm²
- Large piston area (A₂) = 200 cm²
- Applied force (F₁) = 100 N

- Output diameter (d₂) = 20 cm, so radius (r₂) = 10 cm

**Solution**:
```
Area of input piston: A₁ = πr₁² = π × 1² = π cm²
Area of output piston: A₂ = πr₂² = π × 10² = 100π cm²
Mechanical Advantage = A₂/A₁ = 100π/π = 100

- Output force required (F₂) = 12,000 N
- Output piston area (A₂) = 150 cm²
- Input piston area (A₁) = 3 cm²

**Solution**:
```
From Pascal's Law: F₁/A₁ = F₂/A₂
F₁ = F₂ × (A₁/A₂)
F₁ = 12,000 × (3/150) = 12,000 × 0.02 = 240 N
```

**Answer**: 240 N

### Example 10: Communicating Vessels
**Problem**: Two vessels of different shapes are connected at the bottom. If water level in vessel A is 40 cm and oil (density = 800 kg/m³) is poured into vessel B, what height will oil reach when the system is in equilibrium?

**Given**:
- Water height in A = 40 cm = 0.4 m
- Water density = 1000 kg/m³
- Oil density = 800 kg/m³

**Solution**:
```
For equilibrium, pressure at bottom must be equal:
Pressure due to water = Pressure due to oil
ρ_water × g × h_water = ρ_oil × g × h_oil
1000 × g × 0.4 = 800 × g × h_oil
h_oil = (1000 × 0.4) / 800 = 0.5 m = 50 cm
```

**Answer**: Oil will reach a height of 50 cm

**Given**:
- Maximum additional pressure = 500 kPa = 500,000 Pa
- Seawater density = 1025 kg/m³
- g = 9.8 m/s²

**Solution**:
```
P = ρgh
500,000 = 1025 × 9.8 × h
h = 500,000 / (1025 × 9.8) = 497.8 m ≈ 498 m
```

**Answer**: Maximum safe depth = 498 m

- Brake pedal piston area (A₁) = 2 cm²
- Each wheel cylinder area (A₂) = 8 cm²
- Number of wheel cylinders = 4
- Applied force (F₁) = 50 N

**Solution**:

Force at each wheel cylinder: F₂ = F₁ × (A₂/A₁) = 50 × (8/2) = 200 N
Total braking force = 4 × 200 = 800 N
```

**Answer**: Total braking force = 800 N
