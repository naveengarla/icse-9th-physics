# 4.8 Examples and Numerical Problems

## Basic Pressure Calculations

### Example 1: Thrust and Pressure
**Problem**: A block of weight 200 N rests on a table with contact area 0.05 m². Calculate the pressure exerted by the block on the table.

**Solution**:
- Given: Force (F) = 200 N, Area (A) = 0.05 m²
- Pressure = Force/Area = 200/0.05 = 4000 Pa = 4 kPa

**Answer**: 4000 Pa or 4 kPa

### Example 2: Comparing Pressures
**Problem**: Compare the pressure exerted by:
a) A person (60 kg) standing on both feet (total area = 400 cm²)
b) The same person standing on one foot (area = 200 cm²)

**Solution**:
- Weight = 60 × 9.8 = 588 N

a) Pressure on both feet = 588/(400 × 10⁻⁴) = 588/0.04 = 14,700 Pa
b) Pressure on one foot = 588/(200 × 10⁻⁴) = 588/0.02 = 29,400 Pa

**Answer**: Pressure doubles when standing on one foot.

## Liquid Column Pressure Problems

### Example 3: Water Column Pressure
**Problem**: Calculate the pressure at the bottom of a water tank 3 m deep. (Take ρ_water = 1000 kg/m³, g = 9.8 m/s²)

**Solution**:
- Given: h = 3 m, ρ = 1000 kg/m³, g = 9.8 m/s²
- P = ρgh = 1000 × 9.8 × 3 = 29,400 Pa = 29.4 kPa

**Answer**: 29,400 Pa or 29.4 kPa

### Example 4: Mercury Barometer
**Problem**: A mercury barometer reads 750 mmHg. Calculate the atmospheric pressure. (ρ_mercury = 13,600 kg/m³)

**Solution**:
- Given: h = 750 mm = 0.75 m, ρ = 13,600 kg/m³
- P = ρgh = 13,600 × 9.8 × 0.75 = 99,960 Pa ≈ 100 kPa

**Answer**: 99,960 Pa or approximately 100 kPa

### Example 5: Different Liquids
**Problem**: At what depth in water will the pressure be equal to the pressure at 0.76 m depth in mercury?

**Solution**:
- Pressure in mercury: P = ρ_Hg × g × h_Hg = 13,600 × 9.8 × 0.76
- For equal pressure in water: ρ_water × g × h_water = ρ_Hg × g × h_Hg
- h_water = (13,600 × 0.76)/1000 = 10.336 m

**Answer**: 10.34 m depth in water

## Pascal's Law Applications

### Example 6: Hydraulic Press
**Problem**: A hydraulic press has pistons of area 20 cm² and 800 cm². If a force of 150 N is applied to the smaller piston, find the force on the larger piston.

**Solution**:
- Given: A₁ = 20 cm², A₂ = 800 cm², F₁ = 150 N
- Using Pascal's law: F₂/F₁ = A₂/A₁
- F₂ = F₁ × (A₂/A₁) = 150 × (800/20) = 150 × 40 = 6000 N

**Answer**: 6000 N or 6 kN

### Example 7: Mechanical Advantage
**Problem**: Calculate the mechanical advantage of the hydraulic press in Example 6.

**Solution**:
- Mechanical Advantage = A₂/A₁ = 800/20 = 40
- This means the output force is 40 times the input force.

**Answer**: Mechanical advantage = 40

### Example 8: Hydraulic Jack
**Problem**: A hydraulic jack has piston areas in the ratio 1:50. If an effort of 200 N is applied, what load can be lifted?

**Solution**:
- Given: A₁:A₂ = 1:50, F₁ = 200 N
- F₂ = F₁ × (A₂/A₁) = 200 × 50 = 10,000 N = 10 kN

**Answer**: 10,000 N or 10 kN can be lifted

## Combined Problems

### Example 9: Pressure at Different Depths
**Problem**: In a swimming pool, calculate the pressure at depths of 1 m, 2 m, and 3 m below the surface.

**Solution**:
At 1 m: P = ρgh = 1000 × 9.8 × 1 = 9,800 Pa = 9.8 kPa
At 2 m: P = ρgh = 1000 × 9.8 × 2 = 19,600 Pa = 19.6 kPa
At 3 m: P = ρgh = 1000 × 9.8 × 3 = 29,400 Pa = 29.4 kPa

**Answer**: 9.8 kPa, 19.6 kPa, and 29.4 kPa respectively

### Example 10: Total Pressure
**Problem**: Calculate the total pressure at 2 m depth in a lake. (Atmospheric pressure = 101.3 kPa)

**Solution**:
- Gauge pressure = ρgh = 1000 × 9.8 × 2 = 19,600 Pa = 19.6 kPa
- Total pressure = Atmospheric + Gauge = 101.3 + 19.6 = 120.9 kPa

**Answer**: 120.9 kPa
