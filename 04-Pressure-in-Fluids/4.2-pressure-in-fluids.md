# 4.2 Pressure in Fluids

## What are Fluids?

**Fluids** are substances that can flow and take the shape of their container. This includes:
- **Liquids** (water, oil, mercury, etc.)
- **Gases** (air, oxygen, carbon dioxide, etc.)

## Characteristics of Fluid Pressure

### 1. Omnidirectional Nature
- Fluid pressure acts in all directions at any given point
- The pressure at a point is the same in all directions

### 2. Perpendicular Action
- Fluid pressure always acts perpendicular to the surface in contact
- No component of pressure acts parallel to the surface

### 3. Transmission Property
- Pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted equally in all directions
- This forms the basis of Pascal's law

## Pressure in Liquids vs. Gases

### Liquids
- **Incompressible**: Density remains nearly constant
- **High density**: Significant pressure variations with depth
- **Surface effects**: Free surface exists

### Gases
- **Compressible**: Density varies with pressure
- **Low density**: Smaller pressure variations with height
- **Expansion**: Fills entire container

## Atmospheric Pressure

### Definition
The pressure exerted by the atmosphere at any point due to the weight of the air column above it.

### Standard Atmospheric Pressure
- **Value**: 1 atm = 101,325 Pa = 760 mmHg
- **At sea level**: Standard reference point

### Measurement
- **Barometer**: Device used to measure atmospheric pressure
- **Mercury barometer**: Uses mercury column height
- **Aneroid barometer**: Uses flexible metal chamber

## Pressure Variation in Fluids

### In Liquids
Pressure increases with depth due to the weight of the liquid column above.

### In Gases
Pressure decreases with altitude due to decreasing air density.

## Examples of Fluid Pressure

1. **Swimming Pool**: Pressure increases as you dive deeper
2. **Aircraft Cabin**: Pressurized to compensate for low atmospheric pressure at altitude
3. **Vacuum Cleaner**: Uses pressure difference to create suction
4. **Weather Systems**: High and low pressure areas affect weather patterns

## Applications

- **Hydraulic Systems**: Use liquid pressure for mechanical advantage
- **Pneumatic Systems**: Use gas pressure for power transmission
- **Pressure Cookers**: Use increased pressure to raise boiling point
- **Submarine Design**: Must withstand enormous water pressure at depth
