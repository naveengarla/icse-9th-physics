## 1. Hydraulic Press

### Working Principle:
- Small piston applies force to liquid
- Pressure transmits to large piston
- Large piston produces multiplied force
- Used for compression and shaping

### Construction:

- **Large cylinder**: Where output force is generated  
- **Hydraulic fluid**: Incompressible liquid (usually oil)
- **Connecting pipes**: Allow pressure transmission
- **Valves**: Control fluid flow and pressure

### Applications:
1. **Metal Forming**:
   - Stamping car body parts
   - Pressing metal sheets into shapes
   - Creating coins and medals
   - Forging operations

2. **Industrial Manufacturing**:
   - Compressing materials
   - Molding plastic components
   - Powder compaction
   - Recycling (compressing waste)

### Advantages:

## 2. Hydraulic Jack

### Types:
1. **Bottle Jack**: Compact, portable design
2. **Floor Jack**: Large, stable for heavy vehicles
3. **Scissor Jack**: Mechanical advantage with hydraulic assist

### Working Mechanism:

- Release valve allows controlled lowering

### Applications:
- **Automotive**: Lifting cars for tire changes
- **Construction**: Supporting heavy structures temporarily
- **Maintenance**: Equipment servicing and repair
- **Emergency**: Rescue operations

### Force Calculation Example:
```
If pumping force = 20 N on 1 cm² area
And lifting piston area = 50 cm²
Then lifting force = 20 × 50 = 1000 N
```
