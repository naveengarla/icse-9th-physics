## Key Formulas

### Essential Equations
- **Pressure**: P = F/A
- **Hydrostatic Pressure**: P = œÅgh  
- **Pascal's Law**: P‚ÇÅ = P‚ÇÇ or F‚ÇÅ/A‚ÇÅ = F‚ÇÇ/A‚ÇÇ
- **Total Pressure**: P_total = P_atm + œÅgh

### Important Constants
- Standard atmospheric pressure: 101,325 Pa = 1 atm
- Density of water: 1000 kg/m¬≥
- Density of mercury: 13,600 kg/m¬≥
- Acceleration due to gravity: g = 9.8 m/s¬≤

## Study Tips

### For Better Understanding
1. **Visualize**: Draw diagrams for pressure problems
2. **Connect**: Relate concepts to everyday experiences
3. **Practice**: Work through numerical problems regularly
4. **Observe**: Notice hydraulic systems in daily life

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Confusing gauge pressure with absolute pressure
- Forgetting to convert units (cm to m, cm¬≤ to m¬≤)
- Mixing up areas and radii in circular piston calculations
- Ignoring atmospheric pressure in open container problems

### Memory Aids
- **P.A.R.**: Pressure = P, Area = A, Remember radius for circles
- **œÅgh**: "Rho-g-h" for liquid column pressure
- **Pascal's Push**: Pressure pushes equally in all directions
