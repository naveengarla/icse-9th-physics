### Question 10
The pressure exerted by a liquid depends on the amount of liquid in the container.
**Answer: False** (Pressure depends only on height, density, and gravity)

**Answer: True**

### Question 12

**Answer: True**

### Question 13

**Answer: True**

### Question 14
The mechanical advantage of a hydraulic system can be less than 1.
**Answer: True** (When output piston area is smaller than input piston area)

## Short Answer Questions

### Question 15
Why does a sharp knife cut better than a blunt knife?
**Answer:** A sharp knife has a smaller contact area, creating higher pressure for the same applied force, making cutting easier.

### Question 16
Explain why atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude.
**Answer:** At higher altitudes, there is less air column above, resulting in lower atmospheric pressure due to reduced weight of air.

### Question 17
Why do dams have thicker walls at the bottom than at the top?
**Answer:** Water pressure increases with depth, so the bottom of the dam experiences much higher pressure and needs thicker walls for structural strength.

### Question 18
How does a hydraulic jack multiply force?
**Answer:** By applying Pascal's law - small force on small piston creates pressure that acts on larger piston, producing proportionally larger force.

## Conceptual Questions

### Question 19
**Scenario:** Two identical containers are filled with water. One is cylindrical and the other is conical (wider at top). Both have the same height and base area.
**Question:** Compare the pressure at the bottom of both containers.
**Answer:** The pressure at the bottom is identical in both containers because pressure depends only on height (h), density (ρ), and gravity (g), not on container shape.

### Question 20
**Scenario:** A person can lift a 50 kg mass directly but can lift a 500 kg car using a hydraulic jack.
**Question:** Explain how this is possible without violating energy conservation.
**Answer:** The hydraulic jack provides mechanical advantage by multiplying force. While the output force is 10 times larger, the input piston must move 10 times the distance of the output piston, conserving energy (Work = Force × Distance).

### Question 21
**Scenario:** A submarine at 100 m depth experiences enormous water pressure.
**Question:** Why doesn't the submarine get crushed if the pressure inside is much lower than outside?
**Answer:** The submarine's hull is designed to withstand the pressure difference. Additionally, some submarines maintain internal pressure close to external pressure to reduce stress on the hull structure.

### Question 22
**Scenario:** Water in a U-shaped tube settles at the same level in both arms.
**Question:** What happens if oil (less dense than water) is poured into one arm?
**Answer:** The oil will float on water, and the liquid levels will adjust so that the pressure at the junction point is equal from both sides. The water level will be higher on the oil side to compensate for oil's lower density.

## Application-Based Questions

### Question 23
**Application:** Hydraulic Car Lift
A garage uses a hydraulic lift where the input piston has a radius of 5 cm and the output piston has a radius of 50 cm.
a) Calculate the mechanical advantage.
b) If 200 N force is applied to input piston, what weight can be lifted?

**Answer:**
a) MA = (Area₂/Area₁) = (π×50²)/(π×5²) = 2500/25 = 100
b) Output force = 200 × 100 = 20,000 N (can lift ~2000 kg)

### Question 24
**Application:** Swimming Pool Design
A swimming pool has a shallow end (1 m deep) and a deep end (3 m deep).
a) Calculate the gauge pressure at both ends.
b) Calculate the total pressure at both ends (including atmospheric pressure).

**Answer:**
a) Shallow end: P = ρgh = 1000 × 9.8 × 1 = 9,800 Pa
   Deep end: P = ρgh = 1000 × 9.8 × 3 = 29,400 Pa
b) Total pressure (shallow) = 101,325 + 9,800 = 111,125 Pa
   Total pressure (deep) = 101,325 + 29,400 = 130,725 Pa

### Question 25
**Application:** Pressure Cooker
Explain why food cooks faster in a pressure cooker.
**Answer:** Higher pressure inside the cooker raises the boiling point of water above 100°C. Food cooks at higher temperature, reducing cooking time. The sealed environment prevents steam escape, maintaining high pressure.

## Critical Thinking Questions

### Question 26
**Challenge:** Design Problem
You need to design a hydraulic system to lift a 5000 N load using a maximum input force of 100 N. The input piston has a diameter of 2 cm. What should be the diameter of the output piston?

**Answer:**
Required MA = 5000/100 = 50
Area₁ = π × 1² = π cm²
Area₂ = 50 × π = 50π cm²
Diameter₂ = 2√(50) ≈ 14.1 cm

### Question 27
**Challenge:** Real-world Application
Why do we feel pain in our ears when diving deep into a swimming pool, and how do professional divers manage this?
**Answer:** Increased water pressure compresses air in the ear canal, causing discomfort. Professional divers equalize pressure by holding their nose and gently blowing, allowing air to enter the middle ear through the Eustachian tube.
