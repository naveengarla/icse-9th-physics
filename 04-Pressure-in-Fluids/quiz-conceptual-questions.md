## Answer Key

### Section A (MCQ):
1. b) Pascal (Pa)
2. c) The depth below the surface
3. c) Is transmitted undiminished in all directions
4. c) 10
5. b) Barometer
6. c) More
7. c) Buoyancy
8. b) Liquid level is same in all vessels

### Section B (Short Answers):
9. Sharp knife has smaller contact area, creating higher pressure for the same applied force, making cutting easier.

10. Pascal's Law: Pressure applied to confined liquid transmits undiminished in all directions. Application: Hydraulic press, car brakes, hydraulic jack.

11. Dams have broader bases because pressure increases with depth. The bottom experiences maximum pressure due to the entire water column above, requiring stronger construction.

12. Water provides buoyant force (upthrust) which reduces the effective weight of the person, making lifting easier.

13. Atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude because there is less air column above exerting weight/pressure.

14. Due to pressure equilibrium - if levels were different, pressure difference would cause liquid flow until levels equalize.

15. When we suck air out, atmospheric pressure pushes liquid up the straw due to pressure difference.

16. Gauge pressure = pressure above atmospheric; Absolute pressure = total pressure including atmospheric pressure.

### Section C (Long Answers):
17. **Derivation**: Consider liquid column height h, area A, density ρ
   - Volume = A × h
   - Mass = ρ × A × h  
   - Weight = ρ × A × h × g
   - Pressure = Weight/Area = ρgh
   **Assumptions**: Liquid at rest, uniform density, negligible surface tension

18. **Hydraulic Jack Working**:
   - Small cylinder with manual pump
   - Large cylinder lifts load
   - Pascal's law: P₁ = P₂, so F₁/A₁ = F₂/A₂
   - Force multiplication: F₂ = F₁ × (A₂/A₁)
   **Advantages**: Force multiplication, smooth operation, compact design

### Section D (Numerical):
23. **Water**: P = ρgh = 1000 × 9.8 × 4 = 39,200 Pa
    **Mercury**: P = 13,600 × 9.8 × 4 = 532,480 Pa

24. a) **Pressure**: P = F₁/A₁ = 150/20 = 7.5 N/cm²
    b) **Force**: F₂ = P × A₂ = 7.5 × 400 = 3000 N
    c) **MA**: MA = A₂/A₁ = 400/20 = 20

25. a) **Pascal**: P = ρgh = 13,600 × 9.8 × 0.74 = 98,665 Pa
    b) **Atmosphere**: P = 74/76 = 0.974 atm

### Section E (Application):
26. a) **Area ratio**: A₂/A₁ = F₂/F₁ = 2000/50 = 40
    b) **Output area**: A₂ = 40 × 5 = 200 cm²
    c) **MA**: MA = 40

27. a) **Pressure**: P₁ = ρgh₁ = 1000 × 9.8 × 0.3 = 2940 Pa
       P₂ = ρgh₂ = 1000 × 9.8 × 0.6 = 5880 Pa
    b) Speed ∝ √pressure, so deeper hole has higher speed
    c) 60 cm hole has stronger jet due to higher pressure

28. a) **Gauge pressure**: P = ρgh = 1000 × 9.8 × 0.25 = 2450 Pa
    b) **Absolute pressure**: P = 101,325 + 2450 = 103,775 Pa
    c) **Units**: 2450 Pa = 0.024 atm = 18.4 mmHg
