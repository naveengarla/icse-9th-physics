# 4.1 Thrust and Pressure

## Definition of Thrust

**Thrust** is the total force acting normally (perpendicularly) on a surface.

- Thrust is a vector quantity
- SI unit: Newton (N)
- Direction: Always perpendicular to the surface

## Definition of Pressure

**Pressure** is defined as the thrust (force) per unit area acting normally on a surface.

### Mathematical Formula

```
Pressure = Thrust / Area
P = F / A
```

Where:
- P = Pressure
- F = Force (Thrust)
- A = Area of contact

## Units of Pressure

### SI Unit
- **Pascal (Pa)**: 1 Pascal = 1 N/m²

### Other Common Units
- **Atmosphere (atm)**: 1 atm = 101,325 Pa
- **Bar**: 1 bar = 10⁵ Pa
- **Torr**: 1 Torr = 133.3 Pa
- **mmHg**: 1 mmHg = 133.3 Pa

## Characteristics of Pressure

1. **Scalar Quantity**: Pressure has magnitude but no specific direction
2. **Point Property**: Pressure at a point in a fluid is the same in all directions
3. **Surface Independent**: Pressure depends only on the force and area, not on the shape of the surface

## Examples of Thrust and Pressure

### Example 1: Walking on Sand vs. Snow
- **Sand**: Small area of contact → High pressure → Feet sink less
- **Snow**: Large area of contact (with snowshoes) → Low pressure → Less sinking

### Example 2: Sharp vs. Blunt Knife
- **Sharp knife**: Small contact area → High pressure → Cuts easily
- **Blunt knife**: Large contact area → Low pressure → Difficulty in cutting

## Factors Affecting Pressure

1. **Force Applied**: Pressure ∝ Force (directly proportional)
2. **Area of Contact**: Pressure ∝ 1/Area (inversely proportional)

## Practical Applications

- **Thumb tacks**: Sharp point creates high pressure for easy insertion
- **High heels**: Small area creates high pressure on the ground
- **Elephant's feet**: Large area distributes weight, creating low pressure
