# 4.1 Thrust and Pressure

## Thrust

**Thrust** is the total force acting perpendicular to a surface.

### Key Points about Thrust:
- It is a force (measured in Newtons)
- It acts perpendicular to the surface
- It can be applied by solids, liquids, or gases
- Direction matters in thrust

### Examples of Thrust:
1. A book on a table exerts thrust on the table surface
2. Water in a tank exerts thrust on the bottom and walls
3. Air exerts thrust on all surfaces in contact with it

## Pressure

**Pressure** is the thrust (force) acting per unit area.

### Mathematical Definition:
```
Pressure = Thrust / Area
P = F / A
```

Where:
- P = Pressure (Pascal or N/m²)
- F = Force or Thrust (Newton)
- A = Area (m²)

### Units of Pressure:
- **SI Unit**: Pascal (Pa) = N/m²
- **Other units**: 
  - Atmosphere (atm)
  - mmHg (millimeter of mercury)
  - Torr
  - Bar

### Conversion:
- 1 atm = 101,325 Pa
- 1 atm = 760 mmHg
- 1 bar = 100,000 Pa

## Relationship Between Thrust and Pressure

1. **Same thrust, different areas**:
   - Smaller area → Higher pressure
   - Larger area → Lower pressure

2. **Same pressure, different areas**:
   - Larger area → Higher thrust
   - Smaller area → Lower thrust

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Nail and Board
- A nail has a sharp point (small area)
- Same force creates higher pressure
- Easier to penetrate the board

### Example 2: Snowshoes
- Large surface area
- Same weight creates lower pressure
- Prevents sinking in snow

### Example 3: Knife vs Blunt Object
- Sharp knife has smaller contact area
- Creates higher pressure for cutting
- Blunt object has larger area, lower pressure

## Applications in Daily Life

1. **Sharp tools**: Knives, needles, pins
2. **Pressure distribution**: Broad bases of buildings
3. **Safety equipment**: Broad straps in seat belts
4. **Sports equipment**: Skis, ice skates

## Practice Questions

1. Calculate the pressure when a force of 50 N acts on an area of 2 m².
2. If pressure is 1000 Pa on an area of 0.5 m², find the thrust.
3. Explain why a camel can walk easily on sand while humans find it difficult.
