# Formula Sheet - Pressure in Fluids

## Basic Pressure Formulas

### 1. Pressure Definition
```
Pressure = Force / Area
P = F / A
```
**Where:**
- P = Pressure (Pa or N/m²)
- F = Force or Thrust (N)
- A = Area (m²)

---

### 2. Hydrostatic Pressure (Pressure due to Liquid Column)
```
Pressure = Density × Gravity × Height
P = ρgh
```
**Where:**
- P = Pressure (Pa)
- ρ = Density of liquid (kg/m³)
- g = Acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s²)
- h = Height of liquid column (m)

---

### 3. Total Pressure in Open Container
```
Total Pressure = Atmospheric Pressure + Liquid Pressure
P_total = P_atm + ρgh
```
**Where:**
- P_total = Total absolute pressure (Pa)
- P_atm = Atmospheric pressure (101,325 Pa at sea level)

## Pascal's Law Formulas

### 4. Pascal's Law (Pressure Transmission)
```
P₁ = P₂
```
**Or in terms of force and area:**
```
F₁/A₁ = F₂/A₂
```

### 5. Force Multiplication in Hydraulic Systems
```
Output Force = Input Force × (Output Area / Input Area)
F₂ = F₁ × (A₂/A₁)
```

### 6. Mechanical Advantage
```
Mechanical Advantage = Output Force / Input Force = Output Area / Input Area
MA = F₂/F₁ = A₂/A₁
```

---

## Area and Volume Formulas

### 7. Area of Circle (for circular pistons)
```
Area = π × radius²
A = πr²
```
**Or using diameter:**
```
A = π × (d/2)² = πd²/4
```

### 8. Density Formula
```
Density = Mass / Volume
ρ = m/V
```

---

## Derived and Special Formulas

### 9. Pressure Difference Between Two Depths
```
Pressure Difference = ρg(h₂ - h₁)
ΔP = ρgΔh
```

### 10. Required Input Force (Hydraulic Systems)
```
Input Force = Output Force × (Input Area / Output Area)
F₁ = F₂ × (A₁/A₂)
```

### 11. Height Equivalence for Different Liquids
For same pressure in different liquids:
```
ρ₁gh₁ = ρ₂gh₂
h₂ = h₁ × (ρ₁/ρ₂)
```

### 12. Barometric Pressure Formula
```
Atmospheric Pressure = ρ_mercury × g × h_mercury
P_atm = ρ_Hg × g × h_Hg
```

- **1 kPa** = 1,000 Pa

### Area Units:
- **1 m²** = 10,000 cm² = 10⁶ mm²
- **1 cm²** = 100 mm² = 10⁻⁴ m²

### Length Units:
- **1 m** = 100 cm = 1,000 mm
- **1 cm** = 10 mm = 0.01 m

## Helpful Tips for Problem Solving

### Step-by-Step Approach:
1. **Identify** what is given and what needs to be found
2. **Choose** the appropriate formula
3. **Convert** all units to standard SI units
4. **Substitute** values into the formula
5. **Calculate** and include proper units
6. **Check** if the answer makes physical sense

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- ❌ Mixing units (cm² with m, mmHg with Pa)
- ❌ Forgetting atmospheric pressure in open containers
- ❌ Using diameter instead of radius in area calculations
- ❌ Confusing gauge pressure with absolute pressure

### Memory Aids:
- **P.A.R.** - Pressure = P, Area = A, Radius for circular areas
- **ρgh** - "Rho-g-h" for liquid pressure
- **Big Area, Big Force** - Larger piston area gives larger force output

## Quick Calculation Shortcuts

### For Water (ρ = 1000 kg/m³, g ≈ 10 m/s²):
```
P ≈ 10,000h Pa (where h is in meters)
P ≈ 100h Pa (where h is in cm)
```

### For Mercury (ρ = 13,600 kg/m³):
```
P ≈ 133,000h Pa (where h is in meters)
P ≈ 1,330h Pa (where h is in cm)
```

### Atmospheric Pressure Equivalents:
- 1 atm ≈ 10 m of water column
- 1 atm ≈ 76 cm of mercury column
